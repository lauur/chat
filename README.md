# Chat application
A client-server application that allows users to send messages to each other in real time.
The application consists of two parts: a client and a server. 
The client contains a graphical user interface based on the Swing library, 
while the server listens on a specific port and handles the connections of multiple clients simultaneously. 
The application handles client registration and login.
